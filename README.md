> ⚠️ Read this section to understand privacy implications of using PromptPay QR code ⚠️

- The PromptPay QR code is based on [EMV QRCPS Merchant Presented Mode](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/qrcodes/) specification.

- **The QR code contains the PromptPay ID.** This means anyone who sees the QR code can find out your PromptPay ID (Phone number, National ID number, e-Wallet ID). Please treat the QR code like your personal information.

- The QR code can optionally contain the transfer amount. Mobile banking apps use this number to pre-fill the amount for convenience.

## Mobile web app

For example, if you want to collect 80 Baht from each friend, you can open the app, type in 80, and show the QR code.
[It takes less than 5 seconds](https://www.facebook.com/dtinth/videos/10208543817227100/).

To use it:

1. Open **Chrome** (on Android) or **Safari** (iOS).

2. Go to **https://promptpay2.me/**.

3. Set your PromptPay ID.

4. “Add to Home Screen.”

Features:

- The app remembers your PromptPay ID, so you don’t have to enter the information each time.

- It is a [**Progressive Web App**](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/), so you can add to home screen and it will work offline (Android).
